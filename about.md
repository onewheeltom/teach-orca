###About this resource

Orca is programming like I have never seen before. A friend calls it "alien" technology which did not begin its' lfe as a programming language.
Early in February, I discovered ORCA by accident. Orca is a programming language environment where rather than being sequential, Orca commands and data "live" in a 2 dimensional grid.
In this grid, commands can interact with data in the physical space around the command.
