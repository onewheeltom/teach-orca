###About this resource

Orca is programming like I have never seen before. A friend calls it "alien" technology. 

Early in February, I discovered ORCA by accident  Letters were moving around on a grid with a synchronized soundtrack.

Orca is a programming language environment that is spatial rather than procedural, Orca commands and data "live" in a 2 dimensional grid and interact with data in the physical space around the command.  Orca does not create sound..it sends control signals to musical devices using MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface), which is a simple way for electronic music devices to communicate.

Orca did not begin its' life as a programming language, but a game called Pico written by Devine Lu Linvega. When he saw that people were using Pico to trigger MIDI events, he started adapting Pico to generate MIDI control signals, and ORCA was born.

Orca is hard to explain. It has to be seen. There are no mistakes, just different results.

I thought it would be effective in situations where traditional programming might not be seen as something of interest. There are 26 commands, each a letter of the alphabet. Orca can count from 1 to 36. An Orca program is text file that can be read in Notepad
