# Orca - a two dimensional esoteric programming language

The creator of Orca, Devine Lu Linvga, calls Orca a "esoteric programming language". 

This site is an cross-reference/adaptation of content at the main [Orca GitHub repository](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca)

Please use these materials as you see fit, and contact me with corrections. My goal with this site is to make this material more accessible for younger students. 

* Orca operates in a 2 dimensional grid which is processed left to right, top to bottom
* Each Orca operator (like commands in a program) and its' data is a single letter of the alphabet.
* Orca is an interactive [live coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding) environment where code and data can be changed while running

[Live coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding) environments are prominently used for creative performanc

* ### [Orca operators](operators) and simplified documentation which is more appropriate for learning 
* ### [Orca commands](./orca_commands.pdf) Interact with the Orca environment (printable PDF)
* ### [Orca workshop (PDF)](./Orca_workshop.pdf) classroom adaptation based on Orca workshop content
* ### [Orca workshop {PowerPoint)](./Orca_workshop.pptx) classroom adaptation based on Orca workshop content
