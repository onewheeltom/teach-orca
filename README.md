# ORCA - a two dimensional esoteric programming language 

### [About this project](./about_this_project.md)

This project is intended to build on content at the main [ORCA GitHub repository](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca) to facilitate classroom learning. Thank you to [Devine Lu Linvega](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/devine_lu_linvega.html) for creating such an interesting way to approach programming. And answering my many questions.  

Please use these materials as you see fit, and contact me with corrections.  

## About ORCA
The creator of Orca, [Devine Lu Linvega](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/devine_lu_linvega.html), calls Orca a "esoteric programming language".  Orca is an interactive [live coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding) environment where code and data can be changed while running. [Live coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding) environments are mostly used for creative performance.

## How ORCA works
* Orca operates in a 2 dimensional grid which is processed left to right, top to bottom
* Each Orca operator (like commands in a program) is a single letter and its' data is also in the grid.
* Operators interact when placed in physical proximity to each other

## ORCA documentation and workshop
* ### [Orca operators](operators) and documentation for differing levels of coding experience 
* ### [Orca commands](./orca_commands.pdf) interact with the Orca environment (printable PDF)
* ### [Orca workshop (PDF)](workshop/Orca_workshop.pdf) Classroom adaptation based on Orca workshop content
* ### [Orca workshop (PowerPoint)](workshop/Orca_workshop.pptx) Classroom adaptation based on Orca workshop content
