[About this project](./about_this_project.md)

The creator of Orca, Devine Lu Linvga, calls Orca a "esoteric programming language". 

* Orca operates in a 2 dimensional grid which is processed left to right, top to bottom
* Each Orca operator (like commands in a program) and its' data is a single letter of the alphabet.
* Orca is an interactive [live coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding) environment where code and data can be changed while running

[Live coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding) environments are prominently used for creative performance

## ORCA documentation and workshop
* ### [Orca operators](operators) and documentation for differing levels of coding experience 
* ### [Orca commands](./orca_commands.pdf) interact with the Orca environment (printable PDF)
* ### [Orca workshop (PDF)](./Orca_workshop.pdf) Classroom adaptation based on Orca workshop content
* ### [Orca workshop (PowerPoint)](./Orca_workshop.pptx) Classroom adaptation based on Orca workshop content

## Sending notes and creating sound with Orca
* [midi](https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/orca-examples/tree/master/basics/_midi.orca): Sending notes to a software or hardware MIDI device
* [osc](https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/orca-examples/tree/master/basics/_osc.orca): Sending notes using Open Sound Control (OSC)
* [udp](https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/orca-examples/tree/master/basics/_udp.orca): Sending notes over a network with UDP
