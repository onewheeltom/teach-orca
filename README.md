# Orca - a two dimensional esoteric programming language

The creator of Orca, Devine Lu Linvga, calls Orca a "esoteric programming language". Orca has some interesting characteristics :
* Orca operates in a 2 dimensional grid. 
* All Orca operations (like commands in a program) are a single letter of the alphabet.
* Commands are processed left to right and top to bottom in the grid.

* ### [operators](operators) - the default Orca operators, plus some simplified versions that are more appropriate for those just starting to learn Orca
* ### [commands](orca_commands.pdf) - Orca commands interact with the Orca environment

## Sending notes and creating sound with Orca
* [midi](https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/orca-examples/tree/master/basics/_midi.orca): Sending notes to a software or hardware MIDI device
* [osc](https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/orca-examples/tree/master/basics/_osc.orca): Sending notes using Open Sound Control (OSC)
* [udp](https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/orca-examples/tree/master/basics/_udp.orca): Sending notes over a network with UDP
